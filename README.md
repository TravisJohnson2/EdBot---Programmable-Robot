# EdBot---Programmable-Robot
EdBot is a programmable robot using PIC18 microcontroller. Code written in assembly.

This project was completed in 2017.  The purpose of the project was to allow a student to build the project using the provided schematics, and program the robot howver the student wishes to utilize its various features. The final assembly used during the project has been lost to time.

EdBot features:
Motor driver and 2 motors so it can be programmed to drive.
2 IR sensors to detect objects within 7 inches in front of it.
2 interrupt buttons. In the final project, these buttons toggled the robots behavior when it detected an object in front of it.
